## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Greenfield: React Router 7 SPA mode (`ssr: false`), no backend, Cloudflare Pages free tier
- Static data: Celebrity data in TypeScript constants, images self-hosted in `public/images/celebrities/`
- Animation: Framer Motion 12 for all gestures and orchestration; canvas-confetti for reveal burst
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 CSS-first with `@theme` cyberpunk neon tokens
- Critical pitfall: Deploy skeleton in Phase 1 to catch SPA routing misconfiguration before feature work

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Monitor GitHub Discussion #12998 (`@react-router/cloudflare` Vite plugin SPA mode conflict) — confirmed workaround is `ssr: false` without the plugin for static deploys
